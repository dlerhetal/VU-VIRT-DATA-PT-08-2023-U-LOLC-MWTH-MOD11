Special Recognition: Ahmad Mousa is as passionate and caring as he is knowledgeable, and Joshua Steier never hesitates to help walk us through challenges. At one point, I was so confused by the unfortunate wording of this module, I became convinced it must have been purposefully worded in such a way as to create confusion, but Josh was able to assure me that I was on the right track. Once I understood that the staff are simply blissfully unaware of the absurdity of the phrase "Martian Month", a thing that does not exist as we understand months, I was confident I could submit this project to you.

I always do participate in office hours and study groups while working on projects with collaborators including but not necessarily limited to the following peers: Ilknur Sekmen, Justin Ibeh, Karson Kosek, Kiara Shannon, Luisa Dinwiddie, Margo Berry, Morgan Escue, Morgan Foge, Nathan Johnson, William Brewer, Andrew Clifft, Angela Reed, and Josh Gibson; however, the AskBCS Learning Assistants remain my primary resource when I do get stuck. For the most part, this challenge was more accessible to me, but I did spend my time in stackoverflow.com, geeksforgeeks.com, github.com, quora.com, pandas.pydata.org, sparkbyexamples.com, planetary.org, science.nasa.org, mars.nasa.gov, and interimm.org.
